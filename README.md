# Extendible Hash Visualization

[Extendible Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extendible_hashing) powers the indexing structures of many DBMS.
This visualization demonstrates how this scheme dynamically manages data storage, including bucket splitting, directory expansion, and bucket merging.

## Running locally
The visualization works by using an HTML file for animation, and JavaScript for handling the insertion/deletion events.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uyencfi/Extendible-Hash-Visualization.git
cd Extendible-Hash-Visualization
```
Then open `index.html` in a browser.
